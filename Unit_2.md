# üîê Introduction to Cryptography in Blockchain
## Unit 2: For Complete Beginners

# Part 1: Understanding Cryptography Basics üìö

## 1.1 What is Cryptography?

### Simple Definition
Cryptography is like having a secret code:
- Turns normal messages into scrambled text
- Only the right people can unscramble it
- Keeps information safe and private

### Real-World Examples:
1. **Traditional Letter**
   - Writing a message in secret code
   - Only friend with decoder ring can read it
   
2. **WhatsApp Messages**
   - Messages are scrambled when sent
   - Only sender and receiver can read them

```mermaid

    A[Normal Message] -->|Encryption| B[Scrambled Message]
    B -->|Decryption| C[Normal Message Again]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

## 1.2 Basic Types of Cryptography

### 1. Symmetric Cryptography (Secret Key)
Like a shared house key:
- Same key locks and unlocks door
- Everyone who needs access must have copy
- Must keep key secret

```python
# Simple example of symmetric encryption
def simple_encrypt(message, key):
    encrypted = ""
    for char in message:
        # Shift each character by key amount
        encrypted += chr(ord(char) + key)
    return encrypted

def simple_decrypt(encrypted_message, key):
    decrypted = ""
    for char in encrypted_message:
        # Shift back each character
        decrypted += chr(ord(char) - key)
    return decrypted

# Try it out!
message = "Hello World"
key = 3
encrypted = simple_encrypt(message, key)
decrypted = simple_decrypt(encrypted, key)

print(f"Original: {message}")
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted}")
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted}")
```

### 2. Asymmetric Cryptography (Public & Private Keys)
Like a mailbox:
- Public key = mailbox slot (anyone can put mail in)
- Private key = mailbox key (only you can take mail out)
- Everyone can know public key
- Keep private key secret

# Part 2: Understanding Hashing üßÆ

## 2.1 What is Hashing?

### Simple Definition
Hashing is like a fingerprint for digital information:
- Takes any input (big or small)
- Creates fixed-size output
- Cannot be reversed
- Same input always gives same output
- Small change gives completely different output

### Real-World Example:
Like book ISBN numbers:
- Each book has unique number
- Can't get book content from ISBN
- ISBN doesn't reveal book contents
- Different books have different ISBNs

```python
import hashlib

def show_hash_example(text):
    # Create hash of text
    hash_result = hashlib.sha256(text.encode()).hexdigest()
    print(f"Text: {text}")
    print(f"Hash: {hash_result}")
    print("---")

# Try with different texts
show_hash_example("Hello")
show_hash_example("hello")  # Notice completely different hash
show_hash_example("Hello!")  # Even adding ! changes everything
```

## 2.2 Why Hashing is Important in Blockchain

### Use Cases:
1. **Transaction IDs**
   - Each transaction gets unique ID
   - Can't change transaction without changing ID
   
2. **Block Links**
   - Each block contains previous block's hash
   - Creates unbreakable chain
   
3. **Wallet Addresses**
   - Created from public keys
   - Shorter and easier to use

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Block 1] -->|Hash| B[Block 2]
    B -->|Hash| C[Block 3]
    C -->|Hash| D[Block 4]
    
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style D fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

# Part 3: Digital Signatures üìù

## 3.1 Understanding Digital Signatures

### Simple Explanation
Like a handwritten signature but digital:
- Proves you sent the message
- Proves message wasn't changed
- Can't be copied or reused
- Uses your private key

### Real-World Analogy:
Like signing a check:
- Only you can sign it
- Bank can verify your signature
- Changed check becomes invalid
- Each check signed separately

```python
class SimpleSigner:
    def __init__(self):
        # In real world, these would be complex keys
        self.private_key = "secret123"
        self.public_key = "public456"
    
    def sign_message(self, message):
        # Simple simulation of signing
        signature = f"{message}-signed-with-{self.private_key}"
        return signature
    
    def verify_signature(self, message, signature):
        # Simple simulation of verification
        expected = f"{message}-signed-with-{self.private_key}"
        return signature == expected

# Try it out!
signer = SimpleSigner()
message = "Send 1 Bitcoin to Bob"
signature = signer.sign_message(message)
is_valid = signer.verify_signature(message, signature)
print(f"Signature valid? {is_valid}")
```

# Part 4: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) üîÑ

## 4.1 Simple Introduction to ECC

### What is ECC?
- Special type of math using curves
- More secure than traditional methods
- Uses less computer power
- Used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

### Simple Analogy:
Like mixing paint:
- Easy to mix colors
- Hard to separate mixed colors
- Similarly, ECC operations are:
  - Easy in one direction
  - Very hard to reverse

```python
# Simplified representation of a point on elliptic curve
class ECPoint:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

# Example point
point = ECPoint(5, 7)
print(f"A point on the curve: {point}")
```

# Part 5: Practical Examples üíª

## 5.1 Creating a Simple Wallet

```python
import hashlib
import random

class SimpleWallet:
    def __init__(self):
        # Create "private key" (just a random number in this example)
        self.private_key = random.randint(1, 1000000)
        # Create "public key" (hash of private key)
        self.public_key = hashlib.sha256(
            str(self.private_key).encode()
        ).hexdigest()
        # Create wallet address (short version of public key)
        self.address = self.public_key[:10]
    
    def show_details(self):
        print(f"Private Key: {self.private_key} (keep secret!)")
        print(f"Public Key: {self.public_key}")
        print(f"Wallet Address: {self.address}")

# Create a wallet
my_wallet = SimpleWallet()
my_wallet.show_details()
```

## 5.2 Simple Transaction Signing

```python
class SimpleTransaction:
    def __init__(self, from_address, to_address, amount):
        self.from_address = from_address
        self.to_address = to_address
        self.amount = amount
        
    def create_signature(self, private_key):
        # Simple signature creation
        transaction_data = f"{self.from_address}{self.to_address}{self.amount}"
        signature = hashlib.sha256(
            (transaction_data + str(private_key)).encode()
        ).hexdigest()
        return signature

# Try it out!
transaction = SimpleTransaction("Alice", "Bob", 100)
signature = transaction.create_signature(12345)  # Private key
print(f"Transaction signature: {signature}")
```
